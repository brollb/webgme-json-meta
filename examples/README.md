This directory contains examples that can be loaded using the [SetStateFromJSON](src/plugins/SetStateFromJSON) plugin.

To experiment with an example:
- Create a new node in the root node (instance of FCO is fine)
- Enable the "SetStateFromJSON" plugin from the "Meta" tab in the Property Editor (found in the lower right)
- Click the play button in the top left and select the "SetStateFromJSON" plugin
- Select the JSON to use in the configuration menu and click "Run"!
